title: "Blog reboot"

It took a while but I have finally decided to come back to my blog.  New domain, new theme and, hopefully, new motivation to invest some time into regularly publishing some quality posts.

I plan to write about a lot of things, mostly about software development and the technologies/methodologies I use on a day to day basis (e.g. Scala, Functional programming, Agile, distributed systems, etc).

This blog is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the theme is based on [Lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom), and the neat little icons displayed here and there are provided by [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).  I'll probably spend some time twicking the theme (I am not completely satisfied with the responsiveness for smaller screens).

There won't be any comment section, but it doesn't mean that I am not interested in feedback and discussion.  I am very easy to reach via email, Twitter or whichever social network you want to use.  The handle **vptheron** is the best way to find me almost anywhere.
