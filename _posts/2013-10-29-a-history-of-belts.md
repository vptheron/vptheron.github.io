For this first post I will not write about code or software or anything of this sort. No, for this first post I want to write about belts. More specifically judo belts and the lesson they can teach us.

Judo was invented in Japan around 1880 by **Master Jigoro Kano** who wanted to create a more modern, less dangerous and aggressive version of ju-jitsu. It was designed to be a vector of education and teach important values to students. I began doing judo when I was 6 years old, and, like all my fellow *judoka*[(1)](#judoka_def), I started as a **white belt**. I assume that everyone is familiar with this rule that applies to most martial arts: when you are beginner you use a white belt to hold up your pants. The symbolism is pretty obvious I think: the color white highlights the fact that, as a beginner, one knows nothing and has a lot to learn. After a *judoka* starts practicing and becomes more experienced, he starts wearing a different belt: yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and finally black. That way it is easy to know when a *judoka* is just a rookie, or has been doing judo for a few years, or is a master and knows everything. Isn't it nice and convenient? No. No it's not. It really sucks.

As previoulsy mentioned, Judo was invented in 1880, and it turns out that these colored belts were only introduced during the 1920's in England. Before that, if you wanted to tight your *judogi*[(2)](#judogi_def) you only had one option: to wear a white belt. That was it. *"Hold on a second. Are you saying that everyone - from the most clueless beginner to the greatest master - was wearing the same belt?"* Yes... and no. See, back in the day (when men were men), when you became a *judoka* you would buy a white belt and start practicing. And then you would practice more. And more. You would get up every morning and spend a lot of time sweating and falling and being thrown around by your mentor. Most of your days would be spent lying on the *tatami*[(3)](#tatami_def). And day after day, your shiny white belt would start to lose its color. It would not shine anymore, it would turn gray, and grayer, and then black. *This* was how one could tell when someone was a master or a beginner: the dirtiest the belt the more experienced the *judoka*, and this is how a "black belt" became the sign of a very savvy practitioner.

That was really cool: the only way to *look* more experienced was to actually *be* more experienced, to practice, and learn, and suffer. For real. There was no shortcut, no going to the store to buy a blue belt, or a black one and show off in front of the ladies. You had to work for it and earn it. How could it get any better? Actually it was much better than that.

Let's go back to 1890 for a moment. So there you are, you have been doing judo for the past 10 years, your belt is as black as it gets under the effect of dust, sweat and blood, you can walk around and brag about how awesome you are. But your poor belt is not eternal, and one day the unthinkable happens: it cracks and gives up on you! Don't panic, just head to the store and get a new one. *"But wait a second! You said there were only white belts! How am I supposed to get a black belt now?"* You can't. All you can do is buy a new white belt... and start over. That's right, you have to do it all again: you have to practice, and learn, and practice more, and sweat, and bleed, and fall a million times if you want your belt to turn black again.

That's what judo is all about: learning and knowing that regardless of how much you learn you can never know everything. And when you are done learning, start over and relearn. What you have learned 10 years ago, you have to learn it again, because you simply forgot, or your knowledge is now obsolete and you need to learn the new ways. Even Master Jigoro Kano - who invented the discipline and was the only *judoka* ever to reach the 11th *dan* - was awarded a special white belt (*Shidan*, the 12th *dan*) after his death, because even he wasn't done learning.
