    <p>My name is Vincent Theron.  I am a software engineer and author based in Boston, MA.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in Paris, France, I earned my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée in June 2008.  I started developing software professionally in 2007.  I have had the chance to work in a lot of different industries (such as ad-tech, finance, online gambling) in many different countries (United States, France, Sweden).</p>
    <p>I have worked with several programming languages such as Scala, Java, Ruby, Python.  Other technologies I am exploring on my spare time include Clojure, Elixir and Haskell.</p>
    <p>I am the co-author of <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/scala-high-performance-programming">Scala High Performance Programming</a> published by <strong>Pack Publishing</strong>.</p>
    <p>When I am not in front of the keyboard, my other interests include soccer, ice hockey and outdoor activities such as hiking and snowshoeing.</p>
